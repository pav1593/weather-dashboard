# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) API to retrieve weather data for cities and build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS as per the Business Requirements stated below.

## How to Use

1. When the user loads the Weather Dashboard web page current and 5-day forecast of the weather is displayed for a default city (Toronto, Canada in this case; to be user defined in future builds).
2. The user can look up the weather for another city by entering the name of the city in the search field, or the user can click on a search history buttons (if any) displayed underneath the search field to display weather information.
3. Once the user has selected a valid city name that city name will be saved locally in the browser in the search history and a button for that city will be displayed.
4. If the user enters an invalid city name than an error message will be displayed to try entering it again or another name.
